# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Add LaTeX DevContainer (aldc) tool.

## Repository Overview

This is the **Add LaTeX DevContainer (aldc)** - a command-line tool that automatically adds LaTeX development environment to existing LaTeX document repositories. It integrates the smkwlab latex-environment as a DevContainer setup.

## Key Purpose

### Primary Function
- **Environment Installation**: Adds LaTeX DevContainer to existing LaTeX projects
- **One-Command Setup**: Single bash command installation
- **Environment Integration**: Seamlessly integrates latex-environment infrastructure

### Target Use Cases
- Converting existing LaTeX projects to DevContainer workflow
- Adding standardized LaTeX environment to research papers
- Enabling collaborative LaTeX development with consistent tooling
- Providing students with standardized LaTeX development setup

## Repository Structure

```

├── aldc                   # Main installation script (bash)
├── README.md             # Japanese documentation with usage instructions
└── CLAUDE.md             # This file
```

## Key Technologies

### Core Components
- **Bash Script**: Cross-platform installation logic
- **curl/unzip**: Download and extraction of latex-environment
- **Git Integration**: Automatic repository initialization and commit handling

### Environment Source
- **Source Repository**: smkwlab/latex-environment
- **Branch**: release (stable releases)
- **Installation Method**: Downloads ZIP, extracts, and integrates files

## Installation Process

### Command
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smkwlab/aldc/main/aldc)"
```

### Process Flow
1. **Validation**: Checks if .devcontainer already exists
2. **Git Setup**: Initializes git repository if not present
3. **Download**: Fetches latex-environment from release branch
4. **Integration**: Merges environment files with existing project
5. **Backup**: Creates backups of conflicting files with `-aldc` suffix
6. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files and commits changes

## Environment Features Added

### Development Environment
- **LaTeX Compilation**: Automatic PDF generation with latexmk
- **textlint Integration**: Real-time Japanese document proofreading
- **SyncTeX Support**: Bidirectional navigation between source and PDF
- **VS Code Extensions**: Pre-configured LaTeX development tools

### Automation Features
- **Pull Request PDF**: Automatic PDF generation on PR creation
- **Review Requests**: Automatic reviewer assignment
- **Quality Checks**: Integrated document quality validation

## Ecosystem Integration

### LaTeX Thesis Environment
This tool serves as an entry point to the broader LaTeX thesis environment ecosystem:

- **latex-environment**: Core development environment (source)
- **texlive-ja-textlint**: Underlying Docker image with LaTeX + textlint
- **sotsuron-template**: Target template for thesis development
- **wr-template**: Target template for weekly reports

### Dependency Chain
```
aldc (installation tool)
  ↓ downloads and integrates
latex-environment (DevContainer template)
  ↓ uses
texlive-ja-textlint (Docker base image)
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Research Paper Development
- Existing LaTeX projects needing modern development environment
- Collaborative research with multiple authors
- Academic papers requiring consistent formatting and quality

### Student Projects
- Converting course assignments to standardized environment
- Thesis development with faculty review workflow
- Learning LaTeX with integrated quality tools

### Faculty Workflow
- Providing consistent environment for student submissions
- Standardizing LaTeX development across courses
- Enabling automated review and feedback processes

## Configuration Details

### Default Settings
- **Repository**: smkwlab/latex-environment
- **Branch**: release (for stability)
- **Installation Location**: Current working directory
- **Backup Strategy**: Conflicts renamed with `-aldc` suffix

### File Integration Logic
- Non-conflicting files: Direct copy
- Conflicting files: Original backed up, new version installed
- Directory structure: Automatically created as needed
- Git history: Preserved with automatic commits

## Development Guidelines

### Script Maintenance
- Follow POSIX shell compatibility (sh/bash)
- Maintain cross-platform support (Linux/macOS/Windows with Git Bash)
- Ensure idempotent execution (safe to run multiple times)
- Provide clear error messages and status updates

### Error Handling
- Check for existing .devcontainer before installation
- Validate curl/unzip availability
- Handle network connectivity issues gracefully
- Provide rollback information for troubleshooting

## Platform Compatibility

### Supported Systems
- **Linux**: Native bash support
- **macOS**: Native bash support via Terminal
- **Windows**: Git Bash environment required

### Prerequisites
- Git (for repository management)
- curl (for downloading releases)
- unzip (for archive extraction)
- Internet connectivity (for latex-environment download)

## Important Notes

### Installation Safety
- **Backup Creation**: Conflicting files automatically backed up
- **Git Integration**: Changes committed to preserve history
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times (exits if already installed)
- **Rollback**: Manual rollback possible using backup files

### Post-Installation
- **VS Code Required**: DevContainer setup requires VS Code with DevContainer extension
- **Docker Required**: Underlying environment runs in Docker containers
- **First Launch**: Initial container build may take several minutes

## Security Considerations

- Downloads from official smkwlab repository only
- Uses HTTPS for all network communications
- No external dependencies beyond standard unix tools
- Repository verification through GitHub's infrastructure

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Permission Issues
- Ensure write permissions in target directory
- Run with appropriate user privileges (avoid root when possible)

### Network Issues
- Verify internet connectivity and GitHub access
- Check corporate firewall/proxy settings
- Consider manual download if automated fails

### Existing Environment Conflicts
- Review `-aldc` backup files for important customizations
- Manual merge may be required for complex configurations
- Consider fresh installation in new directory if conflicts are extensive
